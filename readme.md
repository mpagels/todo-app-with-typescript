# ToDo app with React and Typescript

This is a very very basic toto app. You can

- add a todo
- mark a todo as done or undone
- you can delete a todo

My focus with this app is mainly to use and learn typescript.

### Development

- Clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
